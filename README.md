# Scientific_Document_Chatbot_Mined_2024

## Overview
This project aims to develop a chatbot capable of extracting information and answering questions from scientific documents. It utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to process documents, generate responses, and provide a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Dependencies
The first cell of the final.ipynb will setup and install all dependencies required for the project.
Commands are
```

!pip install python-pptx
!pip install gradio
```
#A brief on further flow of the project
## 1. Uploading File
File can uploaded on 3 types .i.e our project supports 3 document types .pptx, .pdf, .docx.
We have provided user friendly interface using Gradio for uploading files.
## 2. Document-type detector
We have implemented a document type detector for detecting the extension of document.
## 3. Parsing
After document type is known, we will be calling specific parser for that document.
## 4. Chunking
After parsing , we are creating chunks of the documents using Langchain .split_text() function.
## 5. Creating Embeddings and store it to vector stores
Chunks will be passed to HuggingFaceEmbeddings and then will be stored into vector stores
```
db = FAISS.from_texts(chunked_documents, HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2'))
retriever = db.as_retriever()
```
## 6. Creating RAG chain
Emebddings generated using HuggingFaceEmbeddings will be passed to RAG chain which is calling Mistral 7B Large language model's API.
## 7. Query answering/Chat with PDF
An user interface is created by us using Gradio for asking queries which will give answers based on the research document.
